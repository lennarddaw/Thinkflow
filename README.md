# 🚀 Thinkflow

Thinkflow is a decentralized platform for protecting and monetizing ideas on the blockchain. Creators can timestamp, register ownership, and license their intellectual property in a trustless, transparent manner—leveraging smart contracts to ensure fair compensation and provenance.

🔒 Secure your ideas, prove ownership, and earn revenue through blockchain-based licensing.

## 📦 Features

- ⏱️ **Idea Timestamping** – Record idea creation time on-chain for immutable proof  
- 🔐 **Ownership Registration** – Store metadata and ownership records via smart contracts  
- 💰 **Monetization & Licensing** – Set usage fees, royalty rates, and payment terms for licenses  
- 🌐 **Decentralized Marketplace** – Browse, search, and purchase idea licenses without intermediaries  
- 📊 **Transparent Records** – Audit all transactions, royalty distributions, and licensing history  
- 🔄 **Revocable Licenses** – Owners can revoke or update license terms at any time  
- 🛠️ **Extensible SDK** – Integrate Thinkflow functions into dApps via JavaScript/Python libraries

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 14.x  
- npm or yarn  
- Truffle or Hardhat (for contract compilation/deployment)  
- Python 3.8+ (for Python SDK usage)  
- A local Ethereum node (Ganache) or testnet endpoint (e.g., Infura)  

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lennarddaw/Thinkflow.git
   cd Thinkflow

🧠 Use Cases
Researchers timestamping inventions and publishing proofs

Creators licensing digital art, music compositions, or written works

Developers launching dApps that integrate idea marketplaces

Organizations tracking IP portfolios with transparent history

Legal audits requiring immutable proof of idea origination

🛡️ Philosophy
Thinkflow champions a future where intellectual property is managed transparently and fairly—without centralized gatekeepers. By leveraging blockchain’s immutability and smart contracts, we aim to:

Empower Creators: Provide verifiable ownership and direct monetization channels.

Ensure Transparency: Every transaction, license, and royalty payment is publicly auditable.

Reduce Friction: Eliminate middlemen, lower fees, and streamline licensing processes.

Promote Collaboration: Enable secondary markets, derivative works, and shared revenue models.

🧩 Roadmap
✅ Core Contracts: IdeaRegistry, LicenseManager, Marketplace

✅ Frontend Beta: Idea registration & license purchase flows

✅ SDK Release: JavaScript & Python wrappers

⬜ Secondary Marketplace: Peer-to-peer license resale

⬜ Royalty Splits: Multi-stakeholder revenue sharing

⬜ IPFS Integration: Decentralized storage for idea assets

⬜ Governance Module: Community-driven feature proposals and upgrades
